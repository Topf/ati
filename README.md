ATI
===

ATI is a basic interview simulator which asks general
questions about your career, values and the reasons you chose to apply, akin to the questions in which you
may be asked in a real FAANG/finance/start-up interview.

ATI is inspired from iPG, which was written by James Cunningham and Colin Hayhurst for their
Y-Combinator interview
